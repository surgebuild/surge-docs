# BitVM [Unleashing Smart Contract Capabilities on Bitcoin]

BitVM is an approach that introduces the concept of Turing-complete smart contracts to the Bitcoin blockchain, without necessitating any changes to Bitcoin's consensus rules. It's built on the foundation of existing Bitcoin opcodes like hash locks, timelocks, and large Taproot trees, making the blockchain capable of verifying complex computations off-chain through a mechanism known as optimistic rollups​​​​.

This opens up Bitcoin to a new realm of possibilities, including trustless bridges, prediction markets, and more complex contract functionalities previously thought to be exclusive to blockchains like Ethereum​​.

However, BitVM also faces certain limitations, particularly in its current form which only supports interactions between two parties, limiting its potential use cases. Moreover, it introduces challenges in managing off-chain data, which can lead to high operational costs and complexity​​​​.

## How BitVM works ?

BitVM takes problem solving logic outside Bitcoin

### How the normal computation works

All computer programs are executed using logic gates

The most interesting gate is NAND gate. Because using only NAND gates, you can build any other logic gate. BitVM uses Hashlocks, OP_BOOLAND and OP_NOT to make NAND

BitVm unlocks any computation on Bitcoin without changing its core using NAND gates
and challenges.

We can even build trust-minimized two-way peg mechanism, secured by ZK proofs and BitVM. As long as the single verifier in the BitVM setup is honest, it remains secure. This represents a significant improvement over existing solutions, such as open and closed federations.
