# Finality [Using Bitcoin Layer for Ensuring Irreversible Transactions on the Blockchain]

## Stacks Model for Achieving Absolute Bitcoin Finality

Finality is the assurance or guarantee that transactions cannot be altered, reversed, or canceled after they are completed and Bitcoin Finality is, transaction is as irreversible as Bitcoin transaction itself.

Here are some ways through which 100% Bitcoin finality is achieved, reinforcing the trustworthiness and permanence of each transaction:

1. **Decentralized Consensus:** Utilizing Bitcoin's decentralized network of nodes to validate transactions ensures no single entity can alter the blockchain unilaterally, solidifying each transaction's permanence once confirmed.

2. **Proof of Work (PoW):** Bitcoin's PoW consensus mechanism requires miners to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. This process not only secures the network but also makes reversing transactions computationally impractical, thereby achieving finality.

3. **Chain Maturity:** Bitcoin transactions gain additional security as they are buried under more blocks in the blockchain. Typically, after six confirmations, a transaction is considered final due to the immense difficulty of altering the blockchain's history.

4. **The Nakamoto Release and Stacks Hard Fork:** An upcoming innovation, the [Nakamoto Release,](https://stacks.org/nakamoto-activation-update) represents a hard fork on the Stacks network, specifically designed to utilize Bitcoin finality. By anchoring transactions and smart contracts directly to Bitcoin's blockchain, it ensures the same level of finality and security as Bitcoin transactions themselves
