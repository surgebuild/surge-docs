# Journey of Rollups on Bitcoin [Unwrapping rollups one layer at a time]

Lets see the Bitcoin Roadmap from 2013 to Now,

ZK Rollups are a layer-2 scaling solution that perform transaction execution outside the main blockchain (layer-1) while maintaining data integrity and security through proofs.

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), Segregated Witness (SegWit), Blockchain Bridges,** and **BitVM** collectively lay the groundwork for implementing ZK Rollups on Bitcoin.

## Trustless ZK Rollup

Lets Understand, How can we build a trustless ZK Rollup

### Main Limitations,

- Bitcoin Cannot Verify the ZK Proof by Design

- UTXO Model Constraints - Validity on Multi Sig

## BitVM ZK Rollups,

BitVM makes things interesting by enabling the ZK proof verifications within the Bitcoin ecosystem with "1 / n trust assumptions", paving the way for enhanced scalability and security.

### Limitations,

- Dishonest Sequencer

- Data Availability Layer

If Sequencer goes rogue, Shared Sequencer Can we be a one of the solution but data should be available, for which introducing Data availability layers is required

With Data Availability Layer,

## Inspiration from Validium, Sovereign Rollups

Data availability can be posted anywhere off chain for

- Cheaper Transactions

- Scalable Transactions

It can be posted on the any DA layers,

- Etheruem DA

- Celestia DA .

- Other DA Layers.

**Limitations with this,**

How can they cross compose and share liquidity ?

But this can solved with the ZKPs which allows the Interactions with all the DA layers can be trustless allowing cross compute and shared liquidity

## Benefits of Rollups

- Best UX on L2s from Design

- No need of External token, But L2s can have there own tokens

- Programability or Global Statement

- Endless Scale & Flexibility, Can we built on anything like Rust, Javascript etc.,

- Economic Density

- Upgradability

## Challenges in building Rollups on Bitcoin

#### No Existing Frameworks

The absence of established frameworks on Bitcoin for rollup development has been a significant barrier

#### Complex Development

Missing familiar tech stacks, increasing the complexity to create rollup on Bitcoin.

#### Non-Turing completeness

Bitcoin's non-Turing complete nature limited its utility, only shifted after Ordinals

#### Skepticism around Trust Assumptions

Skepticism from the Community due to Trust Assumptions in the rollup solutions
