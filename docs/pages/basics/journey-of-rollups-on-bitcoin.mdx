# Evolution of Rollups on Bitcoin [Unwrapping rollups one layer at a time]

Lets see the Bitcoin Roadmap from 2013 to Now,

ZK Rollups are a layer-2 scaling solution that perform transaction execution outside the main blockchain (layer-1) while maintaining data integrity and security through proofs.

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), Segregated Witness (SegWit), Blockchain Bridges** collectively lay the groundwork for implementing ZK Rollups on Bitcoin.

## Trust-Minimized Rollups
Lets Understand, How can we build a trust-minimised Rollup using ZK

### Main Limitations

- Bitcoin Cannot Verify the ZK Proof by Design

- UTXO Model Constraints - Validity on Multi Sig

## Bitcoin Rollups

BitVM whitepaper made things interesting by showing the ways for ZK proof verifications within the Bitcoin ecosystem with "1 / n trust assumptions", paving the way for enhanced scalability and security.

### Limitations

- Dishonest Sequencer

- Data Availability Layer

If Sequencer goes rogue, Shared Sequencer Can we be a one of the solution but data should be available, for which introducing Data availability layers is required

With Data Availability Layer,

## Inspiration from Validium, Sovereign Rollups

Data availability can be posted anywhere off chain for

- Cheaper Transactions

- Scalable Transactions

It can be posted on the any DA layers,

- Celestia DA

- Bitcoin DA

- Other DA Layers.

**Limitations with this,** How can they cross compose and share liquidity ?

But this can solved with the ZKPs which allows the Interactions with all the DA layers can be trustless allowing cross compute and shared liquidity

## Challenges in building Rollups on Bitcoin

#### Non-Turing completeness
Bitcoin's non-Turing complete nature limited its utility, only shifted after Ordinals

#### No Existing Frameworks
The absence of established frameworks on Bitcoin for rollup development has been a significant barrier

#### Complex Development
Missing familiar tech stacks, increasing the complexity to create rollup on Bitcoin.

#### Skepticism around Trust Assumptions
Skepticism from the Community due to Trust Assumptions in the rollup solutions
