# Understanding the Rollups [How traditional rollups works]

Rollups work by "rolling up" or bundling hundreds or thousands of transactions into a single transaction. This method significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed and stored on the main blockchain, leading to faster transaction times and lower fees.

### Execution Flow:

1. **Transaction Aggregation:** Numerous individual transactions are compiled into a single package.

2. **Data Posting:** This bundled package is then posted to the main blockchain, significantly reducing the data storage and processing requirements.

3. **Execution Verification:** Through smart contract mechanisms, the validity of all aggregated transactions is verified, ensuring that each transaction complies with the blockchain's rules.

## Types of Rollups

### Optimistic Rollups
Optimistic Rollups assume transactions to be valid by default and only perform computation and state execution in case of a dispute. This optimistic approach allows for quicker transaction throughput but requires a challenge period during which transactions can be contested for their validity.

### Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups) or Validity Rollups

ZK Rollups utilize zero-knowledge proofs to validate all transactions within a rollup bundle without revealing any underlying data. This method ensures transaction validity upfront, eliminating the need for a dispute resolution mechanism.

### Based Rollups
Based Rollups directly integrate transaction sequencing with the underlying Layer 1 (L1) blockchain, leveraging its security and decentralization. This reduces reliance on centralized sequencers, enhancing censorship resistance and transaction integrity.

### Ephemeral Rollups
Ephemeral Rollups are short-lived rollups designed for temporary computations. They focus on quick execution with minimal overhead, ideal for disposable transactions where long-term state management isn't required.

Rollups, whether Optimistic / Zero-Knowledge / Based / Ephemeral, offer a compelling solution to the blockchain scalability challenge.
