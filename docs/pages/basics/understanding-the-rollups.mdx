# Understanding the Rollups [How traditional rollups works]

Rollups work by "rolling up" or bundling hundreds or thousands of transactions into a single transaction. This method significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed and stored on the main blockchain, leading to faster transaction times and lower fees.

### Execution Flow:

1. Transaction Aggregation: Numerous individual transactions are compiled into a single package.

2. Data Posting: This bundled package is then posted to the main blockchain, significantly reducing the data storage and processing requirements.

3. Execution Verification: Through smart contract mechanisms, the validity of all aggregated transactions is verified, ensuring that each transaction complies with the blockchain's rules.

## Types of Rollups

### Optimistic Rollups

Optimistic Rollups assume transactions to be valid by default and only perform computation and state execution in case of a dispute. This optimistic approach allows for quicker transaction throughput but requires a challenge period during which transactions can be contested for their validity.

### Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups) or Validity Rollups

ZK Rollups utilize zero-knowledge proofs to validate all transactions within a rollup bundle without revealing any underlying data. This method ensures transaction validity upfront, eliminating the need for a dispute resolution mechanism.

Rollups, whether Optimistic or Zero-Knowledge, offer a compelling solution to the blockchain scalability challenge.
