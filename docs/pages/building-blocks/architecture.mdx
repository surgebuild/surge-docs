# Architecture

## Overview

Our architecture is built on the foundation of **Modular Adaptive Core Architecture**. This approach ensures that the platform remains secure, flexible, and scalable, enabling the deployment of Layer 2 solutions on Bitcoin. The design is modular, providing a highly customizable environment that can adapt to various use cases while maintaining the security anchored to Bitcoin.

## Modular Adaptive Core Model

The Surge Adaptive Core allows us to keep the overall architecture modular and layered, facilitating easy interchangeability or integration with the rollup stack that any Bitcoin rollup might choose. The architecture is primarily divided into three layers: Execution, Settlement, and Data Availability.

1. **Execution Layer:** Supports multiple virtual machines (VMs), including EVM and MoveVM, offering developers the flexibility to build on their preferred VM.

2. **Settlement Layer:** Handles transaction finalization using zero-knowledge proofs, verified through the SuperStackâ€”a meta-layer integrated with Bitcoin inscription.

3. **Data Layer:** : Ensures data availability and integrity for the chain, seamlessly integrating with Bitcoin as the DA or any alternative DAs that Bitcoin rollups choose to utilize.

### Rollup Execution
The platform supports multiple VMs, including ZkVM with RISC Zero and MoveVM, with planned extensions to other VMs to enhance flexibility. This allows rollups to fully support the existing ecosystem without requiring changes. You can find more details on multi-VM support [here](/building-blocks/multi-vm).

### Surge SuperStack
>_**A MetaLayer with Proof Verification and Inscription to Bitcoin**_

Our proprietary Surge Superstack layer acts as an intermediary that sits atop Bitcoin. Superstack is a PoS protocol-based verifier network that secures the network and facilitates proof verification with Bitcoin inscription for transactions. Superstack accepts the ZK proofs from the execution layers and pushes the transaction data to the DA layer and the verified Merkle state hash to the Bitcoin L1 layer through inscriptions. By inscribing the data on Bitcoin, we inherit the security of Bitcoin.

Superstack also contains MPC TSS-based network nodes for bridging assets from Bitcoin to rollups.

### Bitcoin Settlement
As our proofs are directly inscribed onto Bitcoin L1, they can be verified by anyone operating a Bitcoin node. By doing so, we leverage the inherent security of Bitcoin to ensure the integrity of these proofs once they are settled on the blockchain. Our ultimate goal is to integrate verification directly within the Bitcoin layer, fostering significant innovation and enhancing the robustness of this process.

### Rollup Frameworks
Surge integrates ZK rollup frameworks to enhance scalability and security for Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.

### Data Availability
Surge offers multiple Data Availability (DA) options to suit different requirements and cost considerations:

- Native Bitcoin DA Layer: Options like Nubit for those preferring integration closely tied to Bitcoin.

- Non-native DA Layers: Alternatives like Celestia DA, 0G Labs DA, and others offer flexibility and scalability.
