# Native Gas Token

You can use BTC as the native gas token on the Rollups. We are actively expanding this feature to include support for additional tokens, including protocol-specific tokens and stablecoins.

This enhancement is currently in development as we aim to provide more flexibility and utility for our users in managing transaction costs and operations on the platform.
