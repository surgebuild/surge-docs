# Decentralized Sequencer [Shared Sequencer in Bitcoin L2 Architecture]

Rollup deployed can leverage the benefits of the Shared Sequencer, creating efficiencies for interoperability.

The introduction of a shared sequencer in the Bitcoin L2 (Layer 2) architecture marks a pivotal advancement in enhancing transaction processing efficiency and scalability. This sequencer acts as a coordinator for batching and ordering transactions before they are finalized on the blockchain, effectively reducing latency and increasing throughput.

Shared sequencer minimizes the on-chain footprint, leading to significant reductions in transaction fees and improved scalability.

Integration of a shared sequencer into the Bitcoin L2 architecture would show up like this,
