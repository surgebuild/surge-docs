### Step 2: Setup Bitcoin Signet Node

Clone the Bitcoin Signet repository and navigate to the folder:

git clone https://github.com/surgebuild/bitcoin-signet && cd bitcoin_signet
```

### Step 3: Build & run the Signet container using Docker compose file:

```sh copy
docker compose up -d
```

### Step 4: Verify Node

Verify if the node is running by checking the peer info:

Access the container:

```

Inside the container, check peer info:

```sh copy
bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo
```

Once verified, you can exit the container by typing exit
