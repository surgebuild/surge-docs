# Surge Node Setup Guide

## Overview

To become a validator on the Surge Metalayer, you'll need to complete several steps:

- Setting up the necessary hardware and software
- Installing the chain's binary
- Syncing node with the network
- Creating a validator account
- Staking tokens and becoming an active validator

### Hardware Requirements

- CPU: 4+ cores
- RAM: 8GB+
- Storage: 250GB minimum SSD/NVMe
- Network: Stable internet connection with 10Mbps+ bandwidth

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Remote Installation (Recommended)

Install Surge using the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://install.surge.dev/surged.sh | bash
```

### Option 2: Local Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/surgebuild/validator
cd validator
```

2. Make the script executable and run:

```bash
./surged.sh
```

The installation script will:

- Install all required software
- Configure the node
- Begin syncing with the network

### Checking Sync Status

Monitor your node's synchronization progress:

```bash
surged status
```

Look for the `catching_up` field in the output - when it shows `false`, your node has fully synchronized with the network.
