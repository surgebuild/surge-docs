# Surge Validator Setup

Follow all the steps from here [here](/developer-guides/run-node/setup) to setup your node.

Once the setup is complete, you can follow the steps below to become a validator.

### 1. Create Validator Account

```bash
surged keys add <validator-account-name>
```

⚠️ **Important:** Safely store the generated mnemonic phrase - it's required for account recovery.

### 2. Configure Validator

Create and edit the validator configuration:

```bash
# Create config directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.surge/config

# Create and edit validator config
cat > ~/.surge/config/validator.json << 'EOF'
{
  "pubkey": {
    "@type": "/cosmos.crypto.ed25519.PubKey",
    "key": "<your-node-public-key>"
  },
  "amount": "100000000surg",
  "moniker": "<your-validator-name>",
  "identity": "",
  "website": "https://your-website.com",
  "security": "security@your-validator.com",
  "details": "Description of your validator",
  "commission-rate": "0.05",
  "commission-max-rate": "0.20",
  "commission-max-change-rate": "0.01",
  "min-self-delegation": "1"
}
EOF
```

### 3. Create Validator

```bash
surged tx staking create-validator ~/.surge/config/validator.json \
  --from <validator-account-name> \
  --chain-id surge \
  --fees 70surg \
  --gas auto \
  --gas-adjustment 1.4 \
  --home ~/.surge \
  --node http://localhost:26657
```

### 4. Verify Status

Check if your validator is in the active set:

```bash
surged query staking validator $(surged keys show <validator-account-name> --bech val -a)
```
