### **submit-proof**

A (zkpverify) operation for verifying a proof by namespace, proof_system, proof, public_input and vk.

request params:

```
{
  "namespace": "string",
  "proof_system": "string",
  "proof": "string",
  "public_input": "string",
  "vk": "string"
}
```

### **submit-community-verification**

A community (zkpverify) operation for verifying a proof by proof_id and verify_result.

request params:

```
{
  "proof_id": "string",
  "verify_result": "bool"
}
```

### **create-staker**

A committee (bitvmstaker) operation for create a new staker account on the Fiamma blockchain by staker address.

request params:

```
{
  "staker_address": "string"
}
```

### **remove-staker**

A committee (bitvmstaker) operation for removing a staker account on the Fiamma blockchain by staker address. This action can be necessary for managing the network's staker list, ensuring that only valid stakers participate.

request params:

```
{
  "staker_address": "string"
}
```

### **register-vk**

A committee (bitvmstaker) operation for registering a new verification key (VK) for a specific proof system on the blockchain by verification key. This is essential for validating the correctness of proofs submitted to the network.

request params:

```
{
  "vk": "string"
}
```

### **remove-vk**

A committee (bitvmstaker) operation for removing a previously registered verification key (VK) for a specific proof system on the blockchain by verification key. This command is essential for maintaining the integrity of the verification processes by allowing the removal of outdated or incorrect VKs.

request params:

```
{
  "vk": "string"
}
```

### **update-committee-address**

A committee (bitvmstaker) operation for updating the address of the committee responsible for overseeing the blockchain operations or specific proof systems. This is crucial for ensuring that the governance structure is current and that the correct addresses are in use for administrative tasks.

request params:

```
{
  "new_committee_address": "string"
}
```
