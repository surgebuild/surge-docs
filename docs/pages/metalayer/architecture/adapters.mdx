# DevKit Adapters [Connecting Rollups and dApps to the Metalayer]

Surge’s DevKit Adapters facilitate seamless integration for rollups and dApps, connecting them directly to the Surge MetaLayer. Designed for compatibility with frameworks like Rollkit and the Sovereign SDK, these Adapters offer developers a plug-and-play toolkit that accelerates development. Through the Surge MetaLayer, any rollup or dApp can anchor data on Bitcoin, benefiting from Surge’s robust zk-proof validation and aggregation

The Surge Dev Kit provides pre-configured commands and flexible options that adapt to various programming languages, allowing developers to fast-track integration using their preferred tools. With just a few steps, rollup providers and meta-protocol developers can link into the MetaLayer, streamlining their anchoring process. Surge then verifies and consolidates proofs, submitting only the final aggregated proof to Bitcoin, which enhances scalability and minimizes costs.
