# Flexible VMs [Flexible VMs designed for scaling Bitcoin]

Surge's MetaLayer is designed with flexibility in mind, offering support for multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) to accommodate a wide range of development environments. This flexibility enables developers to build decentralized applications (dApps), rollups, and DeFi solutions using their preferred VM, leveraging Surge’s underlying scalability and Bitcoin’s robust security.

### Multi-VM Support for Enhanced Flexibility

Surge provides native compatibility with various VMs, including but not limited to:

- **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):** For developers accustomed to Ethereum’s ecosystem, EVM support allows seamless deployment of Ethereum-compatible smart contracts on Bitcoin. This brings the vast DeFi and dApp ecosystems built on Ethereum into Bitcoin's security framework, enabling projects to expand their reach and utility.

- **MoveVM:** Popularized by protocols like Aptos and Sui, MoveVM offers a unique development environment focused on resource-oriented programming. Surge’s support for MoveVM allows developers to build efficient and secure applications, benefiting from Move’s powerful transaction model and Bitcoin’s decentralized security.

- **WasmVM:** With growing adoption across the blockchain space, Wasm enables high-performance applications written in a variety of languages. By integrating Wasm support, Surge allows developers to tap into a wide range of tools and languages, enabling the creation of high-speed, cross-platform applications.
