# Composability [Enabling Modular, Interoperable Development on Bitcoin]

Surge’s architecture is built for **composability**, enabling modular and interoperable development across its layers. With a flexible, plug-and-play approach, Surge allows developers to create customizable applications while leveraging Bitcoin's security.

### Composable Architecture Design

At its core, Surge uses a layered architecture inspired by ecosystems like Cosmos, with a focus on three critical components: execution, settlement, and data availability.

This design allows developers to build rollups, dApps, and decentralized financial applications (DeFi) with more freedom and fewer constraints. Each component is purposefully separated, allowing developers to optimize each layer independently based on their application’s requirements:

1. **Execution Layer**: Surge supports multiple Virtual Machines (VMs), such
   as Ethereum’s EVM, Wasm and MoveVM, allowing developers to use familiar
   environments. This multi-VM approach enhances composability and simplifies the
   development of rollups, dApps, and DeFi solutions directly on Bitcoin.
2. **Settlement Layer**: Surge’s MetaLayer provides rapid finality, addressing
   Bitcoin’s longer block times with probabilistic finality once a block is
   confirmed. The DKLs23 TSS signing scheme further enhances security by
   preventing double spending during transactions, enabling fast and secure
   settlement.
3. **Data Availability Layer**: Surge offers a flexible layer to
   secure data and generate validated state transition proofs for inscription on
   Bitcoin. This ensures data integrity and scalability without compromising on
   security.
