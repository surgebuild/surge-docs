# Anchored on Bitcoin [Achieving Bitcoin Finality for Surge Network State Transitions]

Surge anchors its state transitions directly to Bitcoin, combining zk-proof aggregation, state commitments, and timestamp verification to secure and verify L2 states. By inscribing Merkle roots and aggregated proofs into Bitcoin, Surge inherits Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) security, ensuring that state data is both verifiable and resistant to tampering.

### State Commitments and the Commit-Reveal Framework
Surge periodically inscribes the Merkle root of its state and aggregated proofs onto Bitcoin. This is done through a Commit-Reveal Framework, where the final aggregated state data is embedded into a Bitcoin UTXO. Upon confirmation, this transaction verifies that Surge’s state existed at a specific time and has been anchored by Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism. This approach allows for Bitcoin finality, ensuring that once a state is anchored, it benefits from Bitcoin’s computational security.

### Timestamp Integrity
By integrating directly with the Bitcoin blockchain, the Surge Network maintains an up-to-date ledger that reflects the most recent confirmed state transitions. Bitcoin’s native timestamping provides verifiable time references, allowing each state commitment to be traced back to its exact inclusion block.

### TSS DKLs23-Based Decentralized Bridge and BTC Vault
Using a DKLs23-based decentralized bridge, Surge facilitates tamper-resistant cross-chain transfers. The BTC Vault enables peg-in and peg-out operations that tie Surge’s L2 state changes directly to Bitcoin, preventing double spends and enhancing security.

### Benefits of Bitcoin-Anchored State Commitments
- **Inherited PoW Security:** By committing state data to Bitcoin, Surge inherits the security of Bitcoin’s PoW consensus, making unauthorized alterations highly improbable.

- **Reorg Resistance:** With each new Bitcoin block, the probability of reversing an anchored state decreases exponentially, allowing state transitions to benefit from Bitcoin’s block confirmation depth.

- **Optimized Data Availability:** Off-chain data solutions complement Bitcoin’s limited blockspace by only inscribing compact zk-proofs and Merkle roots. This minimizes on-chain footprint while ensuring essential data remains secure and verifiable.

- **Cross-Chain Verifiability:** Bitcoin-anchored state commitments facilitate trustless validation of L2 states across other networks, promoting interoperability and enhancing trust in Surge’s Layer 2 solutions.
