## 5.1 Decentralized Signing and Inscription

The Signer Node manages decentralized signing operations using the DKLS23 EdDSA/ECDSA scheme, ensuring secure, decentralized management of cryptographic keys for inscribing ZKPs into Bitcoin.
- **Decentralized Key Management:** A quorum-based signing process of nodes is required to sign a transaction, ensuring a decentralized approach to key management.

- **BTC Vault Operations:** Signer nodes manage BTC vault operations, enabling secure peg-in and peg-out transactions for rollups. BTC is secured and governed through decentralized signing mechanisms.

## 5.2 Security and Resilience via TSS Network

The Signer Node operates within a standalone  TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme)  network, ensuring that no single node controls the signing process and utilizes M of N consensus to securely manage key shares and signatures.
- **Distributed Key Generation (DKG):** Key generation is distributed across the TSS network, ensuring that no single party has access to the entire private key.
- **Pro-activization, Key rotation:** The system includes regular key rotation and refresh processes, ensuring that keys are never permanently exposed and remain secure even in the face of node compromise..
