# Super Validators [Validators for the Superstack Network]

## Overview
In the Superstack network, validators are critical to maintaining security, network integrity, and seamless cross-chain operations. The network features two primary types of validators:

1. **Verification Validators** 
2. **Bridge Operators**

Validators can either be Verifier or Operator or with both Super Validators

### Verification Validators
Verification Validators are tasked with validating cryptographic proofs within the network. These validators leverage the Tendermint consensus mechanism to ensure the security and finality of transactions. 
Key Responsibilities,
  - Proof Validation generated by rollups.
  - Participate in consensus to ensure network security and finality.
  - Stake tokens to provide financial risk as collateral.

### Bridge Operators
Bridge Operators manage additional MPC (Multi-Party Computation) nodes that are essential for securing secure the cross-chain bridges, especially for Bitcoin. They ensure the safe transfer of assets between Bitcoin and Surge.
Key Responsibilities,
  - Bridge Operator's MPC nodes to contribute to the security of the Bitcoin bridge.
  - Secure Bitcoin transactions within the SuperStack network.
  - Maintain the integrity of cross-chain operations.

### Becoming a Super Validator
*Details coming soon...*

Super Validators are pivotal in maintaining the security and efficiency of the Superstack network. By combining the roles of both Verification Validators and Bridge Operators, they add a robust layer of security, ensuring the stability of the network while enjoying greater rewards for their efforts.
