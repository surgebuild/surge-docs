# ZKP Verifier Network [PoS based ZKP verifier network]

Our ultimate goal is to enable native verification of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) within Bitcoin blocks. This advancement requires the introduction of new opcodesâ€”such as OP_verifystarkproof in Bitcoin's script language. To address this gap, we are developing a unique ZKP Verifier Network that can be seamlessly integrated with Bitcoin. This module will enable information to be verified and then inscribed onto the Bitcoin blockchain, ensuring enhanced security and reliability until native support is fully developed and adopted.

## Need for a ZKP Verifier Network

In typical Validium ZK rollup setups, transaction data is pushed to an off-chain data availability layer and publishes zero-knowledge proofs to verify off-chain transactions on Layer 1.

However, the non-Turing-complete nature of Bitcoin's scripting language limits its proof verification capabilities. To address this, our Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) verifier network ensures that the submitted proofs are compatible, verifiable with BitVM2, and can be natively verified on the Bitcoin Layer.

## Building a PoS-Backed ZKP Verifier Network

We are developing an innovative Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Verifier Network. This network is designed to ensure secure and efficient proof verification with the following key components and principles:

- ### Built on Cosmos SDK :

  Our ZKP Verifier Network is constructed using the Cosmos SDK, a powerful and modular framework that allows for the development of scalable and interoperable blockchain applications. By leveraging the Cosmos SDK, we ensure our network is both robust and adaptable to future advancements.

  <br />

- ### Proof Verification Modules

  We have developed specialized modules within the network that are responsible for verifying proofs generated using RISC Zero or SP1. These modules play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the network by ensuring that only valid proofs are processed and accepted.

  <br />

- ### Staking on Bitcoin

  - Superstack's Zero Knowledge Verifier offers Bitcoin holders a seamless way to
    engage in Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains without relying on intermediaries
    for asset custody, cross-chain bridges, or token wrapping. This approach
    provides robust security mechanisms that are intrinsic to PoS networks,
    ensuring the rapid unlocking of staked Bitcoin to enhance liquidity for
    participants.

  - Superstack Zero Knowledge Verifier leverages Babylon for staking. Which enables Superstack to implement extractable one-time signatures (EOTS). A technology architected to maintain integrity and accountability. With EOTS, if a signature is reused across different blocks at the same level (double singing), the secret key is revealed, promoting honest behavior among stakers. Those who stake their Bitcoin in good faith are rewarded with block rewards and transaction fees.

## The Critical Role of the ZKP Verifier Network

### 1. Proof Submission and Verification Process

**Submission**: Users submit their zero-knowledge proofs to the validator network.

**Verification**: The submitted proofs are rigorously verified by the network's validators. This process involves cross-checking the proofs to ensure their validity.

**Discrepancy Challenges**: If any discrepancies are detected during verification, they are promptly challenged. This mechanism ensures that any invalid or malicious proofs are quickly identified and rejected.

**Confirmation**: Only the proofs that pass the verification process without discrepancies are confirmed as valid.

### 2. Inscription onto Bitcoin

Once a proof is confirmed, it is queued for inscription onto the Bitcoin blockchain. By inscribing the confirmed proofs onto Bitcoin, we inherit Bitcoin's unparalleled security. This process adds an additional layer of security and immutability to the proofs, leveraging Bitcoin's decentralized and robust network.

Here is a **pseudo code** explanation of how a bitcoin inscription is constructed:

```js
Function InscribeBitcoin(data, privateKey, utxo):
    tx = new Transaction()
    tx.addInput(utxo)

    opReturnScript = Script([OP_RETURN, data])
    tx.addOutput(0, opReturnScript)

    if changeAmount > 0:
        tx.addOutput(changeAmount, createChangeScript())

    signTransaction(tx, privateKey)
    rawTx = serialize(tx)
    broadcast(rawTx)
```

## Benefits of Our Approach

**Security**: By using the Bitcoin blockchain for final proof inscription, we harness its security features, ensuring the highest level of integrity for our proofs.

**Scalability**: The use of the Cosmos SDK allows for a scalable architecture, capable of handling a growing number of proofs and validators.

**Efficiency**: Our PoS mechanism and discrepancy challenge process ensure that the network operates efficiently, minimizing the chances of invalid proofs being accepted.

This approach combines the strengths of the Cosmos SDK, zero-knowledge proofs, staking on Babylon and Bitcoin's security to create a highly reliable, decentralized and secure verifier network.
