# Advantages of Choosing MPC TSS Over Alternative Methods

## 1. MultiSig

MultiSig (multi-signature) creates a vault with multiple locks and keys, sharing the responsibility for its security. It can create a mechanism that requires only some keys to open the vault, making it more secure against key duplication

**Pros:** Better security, as the keys are never stored in the same place (if properly constructed).

**Cons:** Higher fees, less privacy, not universally supported.

## 2. Secret Sharing Scheme (SSS)

The Secret Sharing Scheme (SSS) shares the responsibility for the vault’s security by breaking the key into multiple pieces. This can be done in a redundant manner such that only a certain amount of key pieces can be reassembled into a functioning key. The key pieces can be assigned to multiple parties

**Pros:** Similar fees, privacy, and universal support as a regular transaction. When not in use, the key parts reside in different places.

**Cons:** When created and used, the key is present in its complete form and thus susceptible to stealing from a single place.

### Threshold Signatures (TSS)

Threshold Signatures (TSS) allows parties to share the capability of digitally signing messages.

Threshold signatures require a subset of parties authorised to produce signatures on behalf of the group. The message is only considered signed if a threshold (t out of n, t = threshold of signers, n = number of total signers) of signers sign off on the message.

## 3. MPC TSS

MPC based Threshold Signatures The MPC-based threshold signature scheme divides the private key into many “fragments” in some way, and these fragments are held by multiple parties. When a signature is needed, the multi-party computation ensures that these fragments can directly generate a legitimate signature without putting them together. “No need to put it all together” means that the real private key is never and does not need to appear.

**Pros:** The different keys never meet each other, the Threshold Signatures vault is indistinguishable from a regular vault and hence universal, and it has the same privacy and cost (fees) as a regular vault.

**Cons:** The shaping process is harder on performance, but due to recent advancements in this field very much feasible.
