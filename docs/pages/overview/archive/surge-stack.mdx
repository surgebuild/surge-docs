# Surge Stack


The Surge network adopts a modular approach, leveraging the best practices and lessons from other ecosystems. Inspired by the Cosmos modular design, Surge enables decentralized proof validation, while CometBFT ensures Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus across the network, offering high performance and security. The Surge Integration Kit empowers developers to integrate Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and deploy secure rollups and dApps, inheriting Bitcoin's robust security guarantees. This approach provides a reliable foundation for Surge's key network components:

- **1. Verifiers:** <p className="_list-paragraph">Dedicated to zk-proof verification, Surge Verifiers are integral in aggregating and settling validated proofs on Bitcoin.</p>
- **2. Integrated Signers:** <p className="_list-paragraph">These handle transaction signing and manage distributed cryptographic keys, governing BTC vault operations with precision and reliability.</p>
- **3. UTXO Indexers:** <p className="_list-paragraph">Open to anyone, Indexers ensure transparent and seamless data retrieval, critical for enabling real-time audits across the network.</p>
