# BTCFi - The New Bitcoin Frontier

Bitcoin doesn’t need to remain a passive asset with limited utility, nor should its network be restricted by the base layer’s capabilities. As the world’s most secure and trusted blockchain, Bitcoin holds vast untapped potential. By enabling a vertical scaling mechanism on it, we can unlock a new wave of innovation.

**BTCFi—Bitcoin Decentralized Finance—is the next evolutionary step for the Bitcoin ecosystem, unlocking utility beyond the base layer by enabling decentralized financial applications directly on the Bitcoin network.**

Logically, Bitcoin acts as a great base layer for a robust DeFi market on it, here’s why:

1. **Security and Decentralization**: Bitcoin boasts the most secure and decentralized blockchain network, making it an ideal foundation for financial applications that require trustlessness and resistance to censorship.
2. **Global Liquidity**: With the largest market capitalization in the cryptocurrency space, Bitcoin provides unparalleled liquidity for financial services.
3. **Reducing Counterparty Risk**: By enabling DeFi directly on Bitcoin, users can avoid the risks associated with wrapped tokens and cross-chain bridges, which have been susceptible to exploits and hacks.

A clear demand for a Bitcoin backed economy is observed when looking at how existing ideas like wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum, advanced programmability on Stacks have been received with lot of enthusiasm. Whilst these pave the way into the new frontier of Bitcoin, they still act as a proof of fragmented ecosystem that needs to be tackled from the ground up in a manner that leverages the best practices and retains the essence of Bitcoin.
