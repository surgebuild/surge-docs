# Introduction to Surge [Modular Rollup as a Service for Bitcoin Ecosystem]

Surge is a modular Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) platform tailored for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Its mission is to facilitate global economic growth and innovation through Layer 2 solutions, specifically Rollups, on top of the most sound, hard and decentralized form of money ever existed - "Bitcoin".

Surge provides a platform for launching high-performance, customizable, general purpose or application-specific Rollups on Bitcoin, significantly reducing time to market.

The core objective of Surge is to address three critical challenges in the Bitcoin ecosystem through Rollups:

- <p className="_list-paragraph">
    Providing a secured L2 bridge with Bitcoin Security.
  </p>
- <p className="_list-paragraph">
    Enhancing liquidity through improved integrations and interoperability.
  </p>
- <p className="_list-paragraph">
    Advancing ecosystem development with robust tooling for faster deployment of
    existing dApps.
  </p>

We are achieving this with a novel **"Superstack"** layer on top of Bitcoin.

The **Superstack** is an intermediate, foundational, PoS-based layer comprising three essential components:

- **MPC TSS Bridge:** <p className="_list-paragraph">A two-way peg bridge powered by decentralized Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS), where decentralized network nodes handle signature and key-share generation.</p>
- **zk Proof Verifier with Bitcoin Inscription:** <p className="_list-paragraph">A network of decentralized nodes that validate Rollups proofs and inscribe the [Merkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) state root and transaction data onto Bitcoin or any other Data Availability (DA) Layer.</p>
- **Utilities:** <p className="_list-paragraph">Services such as oracles, indexers, and potential bridges for Runes and Ordinals to Rollups that are currently under exploration.</p>

With these components, Surge will become a comprehensive platform for building, launching, innovating, and expanding the Rollup ecosystem. Surge also offers out-of-the-box support for explorers, bridge UI, wallets, and other auxiliary tools, allowing Rollup teams to focus on their specific use cases and attract more users to the ecosystem.

This approach facilitates the creation of use case-specific rollups and multiple execution environments on Bitcoin, which can position BTC as a real currency beyond just payments.
