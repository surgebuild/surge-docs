# Introduction [Composable MetaLayer to Scale Bitcoin]

Surge is Bitcoin’s first **Composable Scaling Metalayer**, designed to unlock the new BTCFi Economy.

Rethinking how Bitcoin scaling is approached, Surge facilitates a solution-agnostic future where Rollups, dApps and metaprotocols seamlessly interoperate on a decentralised intermediary layer — whose sole purpose is to push the boundaries of Bitcoin functionality enabling an environment with high-throughput, cost-effective and enhanced program expressivity.

Surge achieves this by using advanced cryptographic technologies like zero-knowledge proofs. It takes it one step further by designing its core-architecture to ensure high scalability without compromising security.

**Using zk-aggregation and decentralised verification mechanisms, Surge is tuned for drastic cost reduction in verifying and pushing proofs to Bitcoin.**

This creates the perfect environment for builders to focus on launching their ideas be it App-specific Rollups, GameFi, Ordinals or any other DeFi use-case whilst inheriting the security and the liquidity of Bitcoin.

**What sets Surge apart from most other scaling approaches is it’s zero-dependance on Bitcoin soft-forks or core-level updates.**
