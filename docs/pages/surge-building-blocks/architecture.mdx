# Architecture

## Overview

Our architecture is designed with a modular-first approach, ensuring a highly customizable and tailored end product. This not only enhances the security and performance of Layer 2 solutions built on Surge but also allows for flexibility in integrating various components as per specific requirements.

## Layered Architecture Model

Surge provides a layered approach for launching Bitcoin rollups by separating the Executions, Settlement and Data Availability

1. **Execution Layer:** Supports multiple virtual machines (VMs) including EVM and MoveVM, offering developers the flexibility to build on their preferred VM.

2. **Settlement Layer:** Manages transaction finalization through robust zero knowledge proofs, enabling for fast and secure settlements.

3. **Data Layer:** Ensures data availability and integrity for the chain, crucial for transparent operations across the platform.

### Ecosystem Tooling

Surge enables the use of existing tooling along with the specialized tooling we provide. This facilitates easy integration and migration of dApps to Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, allowing them to thrive within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

### Execution & Frameworks

Out of the box, we plan on supports VMs like EVM, MoveVM., with planned extensions to other VMs to enhance flexibility. Our modular framework allows us to build on top of any rollup framework, such as zk Stack & Optimistic frameworks. Transactions are batched and processed through our framework, generating ZK proofs that eventually settle on Bitcoin.

### Surge Superstack

Our proprietary Surge Superstack layer acts as an intermediary that sits atop Bitcoin. Superstack is a PoS protocol-based layer which secures the network and facilitates the proof verification of transactions. Superstack accepts the ZK proofs from the execution layers and pushes the transaction data to the DA layer and verified Merkle state hash to the Bitcoin L1 layer through inscriptions. By inscribing the data on the Bitcoin we are inheriting the security of Bitcoin.

Superstack also contains MPC TSS-based network nodes for bridging the assets from Bitcoin to rollups.

### Bitcoin Settlement

As our proofs are directly inscribed onto Bitcoin L1, they can be verified by anyone operating a Bitcoin node. By doing so, we leverage the inherent security of Bitcoin to ensure the integrity of these proofs once they are settled on the blockchain. Our ultimate goal is to integrate verification directly within the Bitcoin layer, fostering significant innovation and enhancing the robustness of this process.

### Data Availability

Surge offers multiple alternate Data Availability (DA) options to suit different requirements and cost considerations:

- Native Bitcoin DA Layer: Options like Nubit for those preferring integration closely tied to Bitcoin.

- Non-native DA Layers: Alternatives like Celestia DA, 0G Labs DA, and others offer flexibility and scalability.

## Architecture Layers

Bitcoin layers have evolved to encompass a comprehensive suite of solutions, including Layer 2 (L2) for scaling, and Layer 3 (L3) for application-specific functionalities, alongside Data and Application layers. This structure draws inspiration from Ethereum's layered architecture but is uniquely tailored to leverage Bitcoin's robust security and decentralization features.

- **Layer 2 (L2) Scaling Solutions:** Aimed at enhancing Bitcoin transaction throughput and reducing latency. L2 solutions like Lightning Network, sidechains, and Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) platforms are pivotal in achieving this goal.

- **Layer 3 (L3) and Beyond:** Focuses on providing application-specific functionalities, enabling developers to create bespoke solutions for DApps, marketplaces, and more, all while leveraging the underlying security and efficiency of L2 solutions.

- **Data Layer:** Ensures data availability and integrity, serving as a critical component for maintaining transparent and trustless operations across all layers.
