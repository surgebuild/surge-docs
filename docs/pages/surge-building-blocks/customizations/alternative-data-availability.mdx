## ​Why Alternative DA?

The primary purpose of Alt-DA is to ensure that invalid transactions processed on a rollup can be caught and reverted. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of transactions.

But, relying solely on Bitcoin's Data Availability (DA) can result in high and volatile costs due to the competition for limited block space on the Bitcoin network. This competition can make the operation of rollups prohibitively expensive and inefficient on Bitcoin.

## ​How it Works

For index

Alternative DA systems use innovative approaches to separate out data availability from a chain’s settlement, dramatically lowering associated costs and increasing throughput to significantly improve rollups’ long-term scalability.
