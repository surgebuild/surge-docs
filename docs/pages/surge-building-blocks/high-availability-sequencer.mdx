# High Availability Sequencer [High Standard for Sequencers]

The Surge High Availability Sequencer is a robust, decentralized solution designed to ensure continuous and reliable transaction processing within the Surge ecosystem. Built with a focus on scalability and fault tolerance, our Sequencer guarantees seamless operation even under the most demanding conditions.

### Automated Failover with High Availability
Incorporating an advanced failover system, Surge’s sequencer infrastructure runs multiple nodes across different data centers. Our sequencers dynamically elects a leader responsible for producing blocks, automatically handling node failures or network disruptions. This automated election protocol minimizes the risk of downtime, providing an SLA higher than traditional single-node setups.

### Zero Downtime Upgrades
We’ve designed Surge to allow for zero downtime when upgrading software, deploying configuration changes, or even executing hard forks. By deeply integrating our sequencer technology with cloud-native systems like Kubernetes, we ensure that each node’s lifecycle and status are dynamically monitored, enabling seamless transitions during deployments.

### Surge SLA Guarantees
- **99.9%+ Availability**: Surge sequencers are designed to ensure maximum uptime, with failover systems in place to handle unexpected disruptions.
- **Zero Downtime Upgrades**: Deploy software upgrades and network changes without affecting live operations, ensuring that transactions continue to flow smoothly.
