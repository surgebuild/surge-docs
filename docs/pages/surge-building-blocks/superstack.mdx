# ⏫ Superstack [A gateway to scale Rollups on Bitcoin]

## Overview

The Surge Superstack serves as an intermediate layer above the Bitcoin Settlement Layer. It acts as a foundational gateway that scales Rollups by processing Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK proofs) from execution layers and managing data via the Data Availability (DA) layer and Merkle state hashes inscribed onto Bitcoin.

## Decentralized Network Foundation

- `Architecture:` PoS-based decentralization ensures network security and efficiency.

- `Validator Program:` Our Superstack validator program is designed to expand our network. It allows participants to set up nodes and contribute to the network's robustness, enhancing decentralized validation processes.

## Core Functions of Superstack

- `ZKP Verification Layer:` Validates the correctness of transaction proofs without revealing any underlying data, enhancing privacy and security. Acts as a crucial layer for trustless and verifiable rollup interactions within Bitcoin.

- `MPC TSS Secure Bridge:` Provides a secure, trust-minimized bridge 2-way peg between Bitcoin and rollups. Utilizes Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS) to manage and secure the pegs.

- `Utilities for Rollups:` Includes essential tools such as oracles, indexers, and bridges for runes and ordinals.
