# ZKP Verifier Network [PoS based ZKP verifier network]

Our ultimate goal is to enable native verification of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) within Bitcoin blocks. This advancement requires the introduction of new opcodesâ€”such as OP_verifystarkproof in Bitcoin's script language. To address this gap, we are developing a unique ZKP Verifier Network that can be seamlessly integrated with Bitcoin. This module will enable information to be verified and then inscribed onto the Bitcoin blockchain, ensuring enhanced security and reliability until native support is fully developed and adopted.

## Building a PoS-Backed ZKP Verifier Network

We are developing a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based Zero knowledge Proof (ZKP) Verifier Network.

- The ZKP Network is built on Cosmos SDK, with modules developed for verifying proofs generated in RISC Zero or SP1.

- Proofs submitted to the validator network are verified, and any discrepancies are promptly challenged, ensuring only valid proofs are confirmed

- Confirmed proofs are then queued for inscription onto bitcoin. By doing so inheriting the security of Bitcoin.

## The Critical Role of the ZKP Verifier Network

The ZKP verifier network is fundamental in enhancing the security and trust of Layer 2 state transitions. The key roles of the ZKP network include:

- **Ensuring Secure Correctness of L2 State Transitions:** By accurately verifying the proofs of state changes of Layer 2 transactions, the network guarantees their correctness.

- **Decentralizing Trust:** The verifier network distributes the trust assumptions associated with validity proofs, mitigating the risks linked to centralized verification processes.

## Need for a ZKP Verifier Network

In typical Validium ZK rollup setups, transaction data is pushed to an off-chain data availability layer and publishes zero-knowledge proofs to verify off-chain transactions on Layer 1.

However, the non-Turing-complete nature of Bitcoin's scripting language limits its proof verification capabilities. To address this, our Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) verifier network ensures that the submitted proofs are compatible, verifiable with BitVM2, and can be natively verified on the Bitcoin Layer.

## How the ZKP Verification Happens:

1. **Proof Generation:** Bitcoin rollups initiate the process by generating a bundle of transactions on the client side. This bundle is then sent to the Prover Network, a marketplace of provers that generate zero-knowledge proofs for the transactions. These proofs are subsequently compressed using ZK proof recursion and passed to the ZKP Verifier Network.

2. **Validation in ZKP Verifier Network:** Verifiers in the Proof of Stake (PoS)-backed network consistently monitor for new proofs. When detected, these proofs are gathered and queued for validation. Validators meticulously examine each proof against the claimed state changes. If inconsistencies are detected, a challenge is launched, initiating a secondary verification process to guarantee only valid proofs are accepted. This process leverages ZK-Stark along with the instruction set of RISC-V as used in Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine (ZKVM) for efficient and scalable validation.

3. **Decentralized Verification:** The decentralized verifier network consists of validator nodes and guardian nodes. Proof recursion can occur every 100 blocks or every few hours, after which the proofs are verified within the network.

4. **Final Settlement:** Once verification is complete, the aggregated proof or the validity proof is inscribed into the Bitcoin blockchain, ensuring final settlement.
