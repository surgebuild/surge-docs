# DevKit Adapters [Connecting Rollups and dApps to the Metalayer]

The Surge platform is developing Adapters specifically designed for integration with frameworks like Rollkit and the Sovereign SDK. These Adapters provide developers with a flexible toolkit to easily connect their rollups or meta-protocol dApps directly to the Surge MetaLayer. Through this seamless integration, any rollup or dApp can anchor its data on Bitcoin, leveraging Surge’s validation and proof aggregation to securely inscribe zk-proofs.

To streamline this process, Surge is also rolling out the Surge Dev Kit, which equips developers with pre-configured commands for direct integration. The Dev Kit simplifies anchoring operations, enabling rollup providers and meta-protocol developers to plug into the MetaLayer and submit their data with minimal effort. Surge’s system then verifies this data, consolidates proofs, and submits only the final aggregated proof to Bitcoin, ensuring scalability and cost-efficiency.
