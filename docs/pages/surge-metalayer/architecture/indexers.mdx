# Indexers

To enhance transparency and enable auditing of the Surge Network's data achieving Bitcoin finality, we have a specialized Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) Indexer. This Indexer systematically scans the Bitcoin blocks, focusing exclusively on transactions associated with the Surge Networkâ€”specifically, UTXOs containing unique identifiers.

The Indexer integrates with a Bitcoin node to access real-time blockchain data. It monitors newly mined blocks and parses each transaction to detect Surge identifiers embedded within transaction data, such as in `OP_RETURN` fields or encoded within `scriptPubKey`. By filtering out irrelevant transactions, the Indexer optimizes performance and resource utilization.

When a transaction with a Surge identifier is detected, the Indexer extracts key information, including the sender's public key _P<sub>sender</sub>_ , signature _S_, and the associated data blob _B_. The authenticity and integrity of the data are verified by checking the signature:

<div align="center">
  _Verify(P<sub>Sender</sub> , S, H(B)) = True_
</div>

Where, _H(B)_ is the hash of the data blob. The Indexer updates the set of Surge-related UTXOs, continuously tracking both new and spent outputs. This UTXO set _UTXO<sub>Surg</sub>_ is maintained in an optimized database for efficient management and quick retrieval.

## OP_CAT Proposal and On-Chain Validation

The proposed reintroduction of OP_CAT enables on-chain proof validation directly within Bitcoin. With OP_CAT, critical parts of transaction and proof data can be concatenated using opcodes within Bitcoin Script itself, allowing participants to reconstruct and verify aggregated proofs against the committed data stored in UTXOs.
