# UTXO Indexers [Ensuring Transparent and Verifiable Bitcoin Finality]

Following the decentralized signing operations managed by the Signers, the UTXO Indexer plays a vital role in verifying and documenting the Surge Network’s state on Bitcoin. This specialized Indexer continuously scans Bitcoin blocks, isolating transactions relevant to the Surge Network—specifically, UTXOs that contain unique Surge identifiers. This ensures that all zk-proofs and state transitions managed by Signers are traceable and verifiable within Bitcoin’s ledger.

### Real-Time Blockchain Monitoring
The Indexer integrates with a Bitcoin node to access real-time blockchain data. It monitors newly mined blocks and parses each transaction to detect Surge identifiers embedded within transaction data, such as in `OP_RETURN` fields or encoded within `scriptPubKey`. By filtering out irrelevant transactions, the Indexer optimizes performance and resource utilization.

### Extracting and Verifying Data
Upon detecting a Surge-identified transaction, the Indexer extracts essential information—such as the sender’s public key, signature, and associated data blob. To ensure data authenticity and integrity, the Indexer verifies the signature against the embedded cryptographic proofs. This rigorous verification confirms that the data aligns with the state transitions signed by the Surge Signers, establishing a secure audit trail.

### Enhancing Transparency and Enabling Verification
By systematically cataloging these Surge-related transactions, the Indexer enables transparent verification of Surge’s state within Bitcoin’s immutable ledger. This process is essential for achieving Bitcoin finality, as it creates a publicly accessible record of zk-proof validations and state transitions. The Indexer serves as a bridge, translating the cryptographic assurances provided by the Signers into verifiable data on Bitcoin.

## OP_CAT Proposal and On-Chain Validation

The proposed reintroduction of OP_CAT enables on-chain proof validation directly within Bitcoin. With OP_CAT, critical parts of transaction and proof data can be concatenated using opcodes within Bitcoin Script itself, allowing participants to reconstruct and verify aggregated proofs against the committed data stored in UTXOs.
