## App-specific Rollups

Surge’s infrastructure provides an ideal platform for app-specific rollups, where each decentralized application (dApp) can operate its own tailored rollup while still benefiting from Bitcoin’s security. Developers can create highly specialized rollups for specific use cases such as decentralized finance, supply chain tracking, or data verification without being constrained by the limitations of Bitcoin's base layer.
