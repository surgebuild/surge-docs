## Gaming & Ordinals

### **Gaming**

Surge enables scalable, Bitcoin-secured infrastructure for gaming dApps by reducing transaction costs and increasing throughput. With app-specific rollups, gaming developers can offer seamless, blockchain-based in-game assets, marketplaces, and reward systems. Players benefit from faster, cheaper interactions with blockchain features, without the complexity of managing high fees or delays.

### **Ordinals**

By using Surge’s zkRollups, Ordinals can be minted and transferred with reduced costs and faster settlement times. This makes it easier for collectors to create and trade digital inscriptions (NFTs) on Bitcoin without worrying about the high fees or scalability limitations of Bitcoin’s base layer
